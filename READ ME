FENNEC Flip – Reverse Keyframes with Interpolation

This script was developed as a custom solution for reversing selected keyframes in Adobe After Effects, including all interpolation settings such as easing and spatial tangents.
Unlike a simple time-reverse, it accurately mirrored keyframes, timing and animation curves.
Before Adobe introduced the “Paste Reversed Keyframes” feature, this tool allowed me to achieve that result reliably.
It worked especially well in combination with tools like Motion Tools (Motion Design School), where I assigned it to a custom button for quick access.

Although now obsolete, it served me well for over a year and remains a useful reference for scripting complex keyframe manipulations in After Effects.
